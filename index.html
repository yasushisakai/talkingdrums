              <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_drum">The Talking Drums</a> is an instrument once widely used in the sub saharan Africa continent to transmit information much before the invention of telephones. This communication method was able to send detailed information across several hundred miles within few hours, and it was able to communicate complicated messages as much as the other prehistoric telecommunication technologies, such as the semaphore (optical telegraph) used in France, or the Heliograph (using light). The significance of the talking drums is its robustness in syntax errors using a redundant communication method and self complete using similar but different vocabulary to ‘make sense’.</p>
              <p>In the same manner, this project is a communicational experiment that pretends to translate rhythmic patterns into a visual output. Language allows communication, the exchange of information is the structure of a community, of a culture. There are many forms of language, Talking Drums explore rhythm as a language form; one that conveys meaning and is able to transmit messages. </p>
              <p>We transform beats into bits. We take rhythmic patterns and its binary characteristic opens the possibility of carrying messages, we build a code that can construct an image. </p>

              <p>Acoustic signals have been used to communicate information, predating mankind. According to STUDY, NUMBER of species use some kind way to notice, warn or show a specific attitude. Reverting to the urge to communicate, the project investigates the emergence of spontaneous “Language” and “Music” within electronical lifeforms.</p>

              <p>The drums modify their ‘language’ according to the atmosphere, in noisy places, the language becomes redundant, where in contrast, in silent places, the language reduces to simple in a sophisticated formula. In other words, the tower of Babel, was derived by the context in a bottom-up approach.</p>

          <h2>Indirect interaction</h2>
          <div class="clear">
            <div class="en">
              <p>The drums will communicate acoustic bits to each other, the (human) observer is not considered inside the piece to them. They autonomously act their own roll. In one way, this can be interpreted as the minimal form of breaking the the forth wall in performance art. Which the observer can still disrupt the information transcended to point A from B. (which again, for the drums just thought as noize) The piece lures the potential of indirect interaction. The observer, or the audience can proactively participate to the communication to impair the connection, for instance sending porn.</p>
              <p>Yet the project has another potential future update to welcome the human interactor to proactively amend the image the other way such as rectifying the distorted image.</p>
